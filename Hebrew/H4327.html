  <h3>
   Definition
  </h3>
  <p>
   masculine noun; from an unused root meaning to portion out; a sort, i.e., species; kind.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    kind, sometimes a species (usually of animals)
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
   Note
  </h3>
  <p>
   Groups of living organisms belong in the same created "kind" if they have descended from the same ancestral gene pool. This does not preclude new species because this represents a partitioning of the original gene pool. Information is lost or conserved, not gained. A new species could arise when a population is isolated and inbreeding occurs. By this definition, a new species is not a new "kind" but a further partitioning of an existing "kind." Compare [H4480].
