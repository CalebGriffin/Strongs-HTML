   Definition
  </h3>
  <p>
   masculine noun; from [H2986] in the sense of flowing; a deluge; flood.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    flood, deluge.
    <ul>
     <li>
      Noah's flood that submerged the entire planet earth under water for about a year
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
   Note
  </h3>
  <p>
   Some think Noah's flood was only local; however the description of it found in Genesis 6 through 8 makes this patently absurd. With the possible exception of Psalm 29:10, this word always refers to Noah's flood.
