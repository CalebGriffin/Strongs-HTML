   Definition

  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    perhaps an extinct dinosaur
    <ul>

    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
   Note
  </h3>
  <p>
   Some translate this as elephant or hippopotamus, but from the description in Job 40:15-24, this is patently absurd. With a "tail like a cedar," certainly this creature must have been much larger than any animal known today; however it is clear from the text that Job was aware of this giant beast.
