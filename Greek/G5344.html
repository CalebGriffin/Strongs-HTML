  <p>
   He ruled the province in a mean, cruel, and profligate manner. His period of office was full of troubles and seditions. Paul was brought before Felix at Caesarea, yet kept him in prison two years in hopes of extorting money from him (ser Acts 24:26, 27). At the end of that time, Porcius Festus was appointed to supersede Felix, who, on his return to Rome, was accused by the Jews in Caesarea, and would have suffered the penalty due to his atrocities had not his brother Pallas prevailed with the emperor Nero to spare him. The wife of Felix was Drusilla, daughter of Herod Agrippa I, who was his third wife and whom he persuaded to leave her husband and marry him.
