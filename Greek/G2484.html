   At the time when John the Baptist made his public appearance, Ituraea was subject to Philip the tetrarch, son of Herod the Great, among the regions assigned to this prince after his father's death. It was brought under Jewish control by king Aristobulus around 100 BC. Its inhabitants have been noted for robbery and skillful use of the bow.
