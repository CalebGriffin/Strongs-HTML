   Philip the tetrarch was brother to Herod Antipas, by the father's, but not by the mother's side. He was born of Cleopatra, of Jerusalem, and Herod of Malthace, a Samaritan. He died in the twentieth year of Tiberias, five years after his mention in Luke 3:1. He built Caesarea Philippi. His step brother Herod Antipas unlawfully married his wife.
