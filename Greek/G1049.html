  <p>
   It is used to describe the apartments constructed in the courts of the temple, in which the not only the sacred offerings and things needful for the service were kept, but in which the priests and others dwelt (see Nehemiah 13:7); of the sacred treasury in which not only treasure but also public records were stored, and the property of widows and orphans was deposited. Josephus speaks of treasuries in the women's court of Herod's temple. In the New Testament near the treasury seems to used of that receptacle mentioned by the rabbis to which were fitted thirteen chests or boxes (i.e., trumpets) so called from their shape, and into which were put the contributions made voluntarily or paid yearly by the Jews for the service of the temple and the support of the poor.
