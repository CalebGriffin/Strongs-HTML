   Definition
  </h3>
  <p>
   a primary verb (perhaps rather akin to the base of [G4474], through the idea of sudden motion); to fling (properly, with a quick toss, thus differing from [G906], which denotes a deliberate hurl; and from τείνω (see in [G1614]), which indicates an extended projection); by qualification, to deposit (as if a load); by extension, to disperse; cast (down, out), scatter abroad, throw.
  </p>
