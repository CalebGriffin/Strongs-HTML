   Note
  </h3>
  <p>
   He was elevated to the priesthood by Quirinius the governor of Syria about AD 6 or 7, but afterwards deposed by Valerius Gratus, the procurator of Judaea, who put in his place first Ismael son of Phabi and shortly after Eleazar, son of Annas. From the latter, the office passed to Simon; from Simon to Caiaphas (about AD 18); but Annas even after he had been put out of office, continued to have great influence.
