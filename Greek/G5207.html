   </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
   Note
  </h3>
  <p>
   Christ seems to have preferred the title "Son of Man" to the other Messianic titles because, by its lowliness, it was least suited to foster the expectation of an earthly Messiah in royal splendor. The term "Son" is used preeminently of Jesus Christ, as enjoying the supreme love of God, united to him in affectionate intimacy, privy to his saving councils, obedient to the Father's will in all his acts.
