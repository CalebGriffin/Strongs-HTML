   Definition

  <p>
   middle voice prolonged from a primary πύθω (which occurs only as an alternate in certain tenses); to question, i.e., ascertain by inquiry (as a matter of information merely; and thus differing from [G2065], which properly means a request as a favor; and from [G154], which is strictly a demand for something due; as well as from [G2212], which implies a search for something hidden; and from [G1189], which involves the idea of urgent need); by implication, to learn (by casual intelligence); ask, demand, enquire, understand.
