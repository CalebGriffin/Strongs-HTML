   Definition
  </h3>
  <p>
   probably from [G2204]; ferment (as if boiling up); leaven.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    leaven
   </li>
   <li>
    metaphorically of inveterate mental and moral corruption, viewed in its tendency to infect others Leaven is applied to that which, though small in quantity, yet by its influence thoroughly pervades a thing; either in a good sense as in the parable Matthew 13:33; or in a bad sense, of a pernicious influence, "a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump"
   </li>
  </ul>
