   He and his brother Antipas were brought up with a certain private man in Rome. After the death of his father, he ruled as ethnarch over Judaea, Samaria and Idumaea, (with the exception of the cities of Gaza, Gadara and Hipo). The Jews and the Samaritans having accused him at Rome of tyranny, he was banished by the emperor Augustus to Vienna of the Allobroges and died there.
