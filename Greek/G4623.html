   Definition
  </h3>
  <p>
   from σιωπή (silence, i.e. a hush; properly, muteness, i.e. involuntary stillness, or inability to speak; and thus differing from [G4602], which is rather a voluntary refusal or indisposition to speak, although the terms are often used synonymously); to be dumb (but not deaf also, like 2974 properly); figuratively, to be calm (as quiet water); dumb, (hold) peace.
  </p>

   <li>

   </li>
