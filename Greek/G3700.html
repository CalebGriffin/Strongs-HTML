   Definition
  </h3>
  <p>
   a (middle voice) prolonged form of the primary (middle voice) ὄπτομαι; which is used for it in certain tenses; and both as alternate of [G3708]; to gaze (i.e., with wide-open eyes, as at something remarkable; and thus differing from [G991], which denotes simply voluntary observation; and from [G1492], which expresses merely mechanical, passive or casual vision; while [G2300], and still more emphatically its intensive [G2334], signifies an earnest but more continued inspection; and [G4648] a watching from a distance); appear, look, see, shew self.
