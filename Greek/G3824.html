  <h3>
   Note
  </h3>
  <p>
   The word often used to denote the restoration of a thing to its pristine state, its renovation, as a renewal or restoration of life after death. The Jews looked for the restoration of the world to its perfect state with the advent of the Messiah; whereas in truth, it will come after the Messiah's second coming.
