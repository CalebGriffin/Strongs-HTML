   Note
  </h3>
  <p>
   The Rabbis distinguished two classes of proselytes: proselytes of righteousness, who received circumcision and bound themselves to keep the whole of the Mosaic law and to comply with all the requirements of Judaism and proselytes of the gate, who dwelt among the Jews, and although uncircumcised observed certain specific laws, especially the seven precepts of Noah (i.e., against the seven chief sins: idolatry, blasphemy against God, homicide, unchastity, theft or plundering, rebellion against rulers, and the use of flesh with blood).
