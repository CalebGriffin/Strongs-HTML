   Definition
  </h3>
  <p>
   from κεντέω (to prick); a point ("center"), i.e., a sting (figuratively, poison) or goad (figuratively, divine impulse); prick, sting.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    a sting, as that of bees, scorpions, locusts
   </li>
   <li>
    an iron goad, for urging on oxen, horses and other beasts of burden
   </li>
   <li>
    hence the proverb, "to kick against the goad", i.e., to offer vain and perilous or ruinous resistance
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
   Note
  </h3>
  <p>
   Since animals wound by their sting and even cause death, Paul attributes death, personified as a sting, i.e., a deadly weapon.
