  <p>
   Caesarea of Philippi was formerly called Paneas, but after being rebuilt by Philip the tetrarch, it was named Caesarea, in honor of Tiberias Caesar; subsequently called Neronias by Agrippa II, in honor of Nero. Caesarea of Palestine was provided with a magnificent harbor and had conferred upon it the name of Caesarea, in honor of Augustus. It was the residence of Roman procurators, and the majority of its inhabitants were Greeks.
