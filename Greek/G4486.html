   Definition
  </h3>
  <p>
   both prolonged forms of ῥήκω (which appears only in certain forms, and is itself probably a strengthened form of agnumi (see in [G2608])); to "break," "wreck" or "crack", i.e., (especially) to sunder (by separation of the parts; [G2608] being its intensive (with the preposition in composition), and [G2352] a shattering to minute fragments; but not a reduction to the constituent particles, like [G3089]) or disrupt, lacerate; by implication, to convulse (with spasms); figuratively, to give vent to joyful emotions; break (forth), burst, rend, tear.
