  <p>
   apparently strengthened from the alternate form of [G138]; to determine (as an active option from subjective impulse; whereas [G1014] properly denotes rather a passive acquiescence in objective considerations), i.e., choose or prefer (literally or figuratively); by implication, to wish, i.e., be inclined to (sometimes adverbially, gladly); impersonally for the future tense, to be about to; by Hebraism, to delight in; desire, be disposed (forward), intend, list, love, mean, please, have rather, (be) will(-ing(-ly)) (have).
