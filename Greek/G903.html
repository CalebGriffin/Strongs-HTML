   Note
  </h3>
  <p>
   Balaam was native of Pethor a city in Mesopotamia and endued by Jehovah with prophetic power. He was hired by Balak to curse the Israelites; and influenced by the love of reward, he wished to gratify Balak; but he was compelled by Jehovah's power to bless them. Hence later the Jews saw him as a most abandoned deceiver. See Numbers 22 and following.
