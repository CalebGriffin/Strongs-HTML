   Note

  <p>
   The Jews used this word to describe small strips of parchment on which were written the following passages of the law of Moses: Exodus 13:1–10, 11–16; Deuteronomy 6:4–9, 11:13–21. Those parchments were then enclosed in small cases, and it was customary when engaged in prayer to wear them fastened by a leather strap to the forehead and to the left arm over against the heart, in order that they might thus be solemnly reminded of the duty of keeping the commands of God in the head and in the heart, according to the directions given in Exodus 13:16, Deuteronomy 6:8, 11:18. These scrolls were thought to have the power, like amulets, to avert various evils and to drive away demons. The Pharisees were known to widen (make broad) their phylacteries so that they might render them more conspicuous and show themselves to be more eager than the majority to be reminded of the law of God.
