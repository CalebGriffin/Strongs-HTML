   Definition
  </h3>
  <p>
   a prolonged form of an apparently primary verb (ὄνομαι, to slur); for which another prolonged form (ὀνάω) is used as an alternate in some tenses (unless indeed it be identical with the base of [G3686] through the idea of notoriety); to gratify, i.e., (middle voice) to derive pleasure or advantage from; have joy.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    to be useful, to profit, help
   </li>
   <li>
    to receive profit or advantage, be helped [or have joy]
   </li>
