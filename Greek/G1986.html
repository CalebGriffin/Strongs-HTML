   Note
  </h3>
  <p>
   From the days of Antiochus Epiphanes [175–164 BC] down, there had been Jews who, in order to conceal from heathen persecutors or scoffers the external sign of their nationality, circumcision, sought artificially to compel nature to reproduce the prepuce, by extending or drawing forward with an iron instrument the remnant of it still left, so as to cover the glands.
