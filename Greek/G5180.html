   Definition
  </h3>
  <p>
   a primary verb (in a strengthened form); to "thump", i.e., cudgel or pummel (properly, with a stick or bastinado), but in any case by repeated blows; thus differing from [G3817] and [G3960], which denote a (usually single) blow with the hand or any instrument, or [G4141] with the fist (or a hammer), or [G4474] with the palm; as well as from [G5177], an accidental collision); by implication, to punish; figuratively, to offend (the conscience); beat, smite, strike, wound.
