   Note
  </h3>
  <p>
   At Athens those were συκοφάντης whose business it was to inform against any one whom they might detect exporting figs out of Attica, and as sometimes they seemed to extort money from those loath to be exposed, the name "συκοφάντης" from the time of Aristophanes down was a general term of opprobrium to designate, a malignant and base accuser for love of gain.
