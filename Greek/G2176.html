   Definition
  </h3>
  <p>
   from [G2095] and [G3686]; properly, well-named (good-omened), i.e., the left (which was the lucky side among the pagan Greeks); neuter as adverbial, at the left hand; (on the) left.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    of good name and of good omen
   </li>
   <li>
    in the latter sense used in taking auguries; but those omens were euphemistically called "euonumos" which in fact were regarded as unlucky, i.e., which came from the left, sinister omens, (for which a good name was desired)
   </li>
   <li>
    left, on the left hand
   </li>
  </ul>
