   Note
  </h3>
  <p>
   Its image was a hollow brazen figure, with the head of an ox, and outstretched human arms. It was heated red hot by a fire from within, and the little ones placed in its arms to be slowly burned, while to prevent the parents from hearing the dying cries, the sacrificing priests beat drums. Human victims, particularly young children, were offered in sacrifice to it.
